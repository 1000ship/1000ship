# Why my nickname is 1000ship?

## My old nickname was '1000sh'

In Korean, My real name is "천성혁" ("Chun Seong Hyeok" pronounce in English)
The name is based on a Chinese character. 

### Each letter means

- [千](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheon_(Korean_surname)) / 일천 **천** / Chun - A Thousand
- [成](https://namu.wiki/w/成) / 이룰 **성** / Seong - Be success
- [赫](https://namu.wiki/w/赫) / 빛날 **혁** / Hyeok - Make it shine

So "Chun Seong Hyeok" means "the man who can make 1,000 things be a success and make them shine"

"Chun" is my family name and also I like this letter especially.
So I'd like to emphasize this letter in the way of writing as digits, not a word

"1000sh" can be pronounced like "Chun S. H." in Korean, "Thousand S. H."
I used it in lots of platform services or games, etc...

I would like to use "1000sh", but someone already took the ID. Though I made a little difference by adding "-ip" at the last of the word.

## How can I explain why I use the word "-ship"?

Sometimes, my friends wondered why am I use the word '-ship'.

"-ship" is a suffix like "relationship", "leadership", and so on.
As with this, I just make it meaningful.

> "the man who can make 1,000 things be a success and make them shine"

This is the description of **"1000ship"**
And my real name is still **"Chun Seong-Hyeok"**
English one is **"Dante Chun"**
